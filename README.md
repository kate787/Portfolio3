# Portfolio 3: Analyis of Mobile Price Data (2024 S1)

## Description

In this portfolio, I will be analysing the 'Mobile Price Data' dataset, which contains comprehensive details about mobile phone hardware, specs and prices. The objective of this portfolio is to train classification models to predict mobile phone prices and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these models. The workflow involves data exploration, cleaning, feature selection, model training (Logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbors), model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for KNN. This focus is on understanding model performance and the impact of different factors on prediction accuracy.
